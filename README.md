# liri-node-app
GW Coding Bootcamp HW #8

This application allows a user to use Node JS to make calls to several API's. Users may enter the following commands to access information:

* `my-tweets` - This provides the last 20 Tweets associated with my Twitter account from the Twitter API (there are actually only two, since I never really use Twitter, except when forced to for work...)

* `spotify-this-song` - This allows users to pull information about a certain song from the Spotify API. Enter the name of the song directly after the command.

* `movie-this` - This allows users to pull information about a certain movie from the OMDB database. Enter the name of the movie directly after the command.

* `do-what-it-says`- This is a secret command that can be changed by accessing the random.txt file within the repo holding this app.
